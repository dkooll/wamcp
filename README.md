# wammcp

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that indexes, analyzes, and serves cloudnation's terraform modules for azure on demand to MCP compatible AI agents.

## Features

**Module Discovery**

List and search all available Terraform modules with fast, FTS-backed lookups

**Code Search**

Search across all module code (any .tf file) for patterns, resources, or free text

**Relationship Analysis**

Reveal precise, AST‑aware relationships inside Terraform expressions.

Shows the attribute path, the referenced symbol (variable, data source, module output, resource, loop), and an annotated snippet with file and line.

It's module scoped or cross‑module queries (when no module is specified)

It uses natural language prompts

**Module Analysis**

Get detailed info on variables, outputs, resources, and examples in one response

**Pattern Comparison**

Compare code patterns (e.g., dynamic blocks, lifecycle, resource types) across modules.

Uses HCL AST for tighter, block‑aware matches when patterns like `resource "..."`, `dynamic "..."`, or `lifecycle` are used; falls back to text search otherwise.

**Example Access**

Retrieve usage examples per module, including example file contents

**Variable Extraction**

Extract complete variable definitions including types, defaults, and sensitivity

**Short-name Aliases**

Use short module names (e.g., `vnet`, `kv`, `pe`, `agw`) instead of full names (e.g., `terraform-azure-vnet`).

Aliases are auto-generated from module names, submodules, and tags during sync and work with all tools that accept `module_name`.

**GitHub Sync**

Syncs and indexes modules from GitHub into a local SQLite database for fast queries.

Supports incremental updates and parallel syncing with rate‑limit awareness for larger orgs.

## Prerequisites

Go 1.23.0 or later

SQLite (with FTS5 support - included in most modern installations)

GitHub Personal Access Token (optional, for higher rate limits) with `repo → public_repo` rights.

## Configuration

**Server flags**

The server accepts command-line flags for configuration:

--org - GitHub organization name (default: "cloudnationhq")

--token - GitHub personal access token (optional; improves rate limits)

--db - Path to SQLite database file (default: "index.db")

**Adding to AI agents**

To use this MCP server with AI agents (Claude CLI, Copilot, Codex CLI, or other MCP-compatible clients), add it to their configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "az-cn-wam": {
      "command": "/path/to/az-cn-wam-mcp",
      "args": ["--org", "cloudnationhq", "--token", "YOUR_TOKEN"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Build from source

make build

## Example Prompts

**Once configured, you can ask any agentic agent that supports additional MCP servers:**

**Relationship Explorer**

Show subnet interactions in redis and explain it.

What relation has storage with log analytics workspace and show the flow and list it.

Where do we reference subnet_id across modules, top 3

Highlight private endpoint usage in terraform-azure-kv, top 5 hits

Find role assignments that reference the kubelet identity in terraform-azure-aks and give some background information.

Compare subnet_id relationships between redis and terraform-azure-app

**Module Info**

Show module info for vnet and highlight only the required variables.

Show module info for kv and list all resources it creates.

**Examples**

List all examples for terraform-azure-aa.

For terraform-azure-func, list examples and show the private-endpoint example in full code.

**AST Pattern Compare (block‑aware)**

Compare dynamic "identity" across modules and show one example per unique pattern, with full code.

Show lifecycle blocks that set ignore_changes (pattern: lifecycle has:ignore_changes) and summarize the modules.

Show dynamic "delegation" blocks with full code, and summarize the service_delegation name/actions.

**Focused Code Queries**

Search code for key vault/keyvault access_policy and show matching files and snippets.

Find modules that use for_each = merge(flatten(...)) and list the module names and file paths.

In vwan and vgw, show resource "azurerm_vpn_gateway_nat_rule" with full blocks.

In vnet, show dynamic "delegation" with full blocks.

Extract point_to_site_vpn from the type definition in the vwan module.

**Sync and Maintenance**

Run a full sync of all modules and report the job ID; then show the sync status for that job ID.

Run an incremental sync (updates only) and report the job ID; then show the sync status for that job ID.

**Tips**
```
For AST mode, include quotes around types/labels in the pattern:
  resource "azurerm_...", dynamic "identity", lifecycle

Add attribute filters with has: to narrow results:
  resource "azurerm_" has:lifecycle.ignore_changes
  dynamic "identity" has:identity_ids

Use show_full_blocks: true when you want the exact HCL code, or leave it false for a compact table.
```

## Notes

It might be quicker to use a low reasoning model for the sample queries above, then switch to a higher one for interpreting, planning, or debugging.

GitHub token is optional; without it, syncing still works but may hit lower API rate limits. Pass `--token` to raise limits.

Initial full sync takes ~20 seconds on first run. It is optimized via gitHub tarball archives and a bounded worker pool (rate‑limit aware).

Deleting the database file `index.db` will cause a full rebuild the next time the tool gets called.

Archived, private and empty repositories will be skipped by default.

## Direct Database Access

The indexed data is stored in a SQLite database file with FTS5 enabled. You can query it directly for ad‑hoc inspection:

`sqlite3 index.db "SELECT name, description FROM modules LIMIT 10"`

`sqlite3 index.db "SELECT name FROM modules WHERE name LIKE '%storage%'"`

`sqlite3 index.db "
  SELECT m.name, r.resource_name
  FROM modules m
  JOIN module_resources r ON m.id = r.module_id
  WHERE r.resource_type = 'azurerm_storage_account'"
`
